1. Introduction

   seltest allows you to run Selenium based tests in you django
   application.

   It takes care of running and killing a django test server and the
   selenium server while executing selenium tests.

2. Requirements

   1) Selenium python client driver.
   2) Selenium server.

3. Installation

   Install seltest to your PYTHONPATH, and add it in the list of
   INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py.

   Then set SELTEST_SELENIUM_SERVER_PATH to the path where
   selenium-server.jar is located.

   That's the minimal configuration needed.

4. Usage

   seltest provides the management command runseltest that works
   exactly the same way as django's test command do, but instead of
   looking tests in the "tests" module of each application it does it
   in the "selenium_tests" one.

   So this will run all selenium based tests:

   python manage.py runseltest

   While this will run all tests for an app:

   python manage.py runseltest app

   And this will run just one test:

   python manage.py runseltest app.SpecificTest
